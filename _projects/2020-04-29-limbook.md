<p>This is my attempt at building the world's first augmented reality e-reader. I spent 4 months building the device.</p>

<p>I did all the electronics, programmed the software, programmed the website, and programmed the Bluetooth app. This was a solo project that gave me knowledge and experience in diverse fields.</p>
