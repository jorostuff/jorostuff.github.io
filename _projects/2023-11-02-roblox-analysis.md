<p>I collected 100+ GB worth of games data from Roblox - game statistics, recommendations, sorts, icons, thumbnails, and ads. The Python crawler ran for about 1 year.</p>

<p>I used the data to do some analysis and group games by similarity through the recommended sort. It was a fun exploratory project.</p>
