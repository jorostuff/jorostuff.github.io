<p>Grandservers is a server list platform for games where server owners can advertise their servers and players can find them and join.</p>

<p>This project I did back when I was still learning web development. I experimented a lot. I used to build dozens of Minecraft servers and I wanted to make a server list platform.</p>

<p>I successfully developed the system, launched it and I even had a few registered servers. This is when my interest in web development really sparked.</p>
