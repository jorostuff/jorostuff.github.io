<p>(Back then I was called Kapton instead of Joro)</p>

<p>Kapton's SaaS Starter Kit is a SaaS boilerplate written in Next.js, Firebase (and Firestore), Xkit, and Chakra UI. It's a project I did for a startup called Xkit.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about integrating third party software and using better design tools than plain CSS. I'm happy with the project and I'm glad that anyone can clone it and use it as a base for their SaaS app.</p>
