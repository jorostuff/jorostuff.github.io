<p>
Hello, welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹
</p>

<p>
I'm a human being born in Bulgaria, 2002.
Over the years, I've taught myself programming, science, business, and more.
My hobbies include making music, physical exercise, and reading.
</p>

<p>
During my childhood years, I attended a local public school, played video games, and hung out with a few friends.
I had the habit of getting interested in something for a few months and then moving on to the next thing.
Over the years, I've attended lessons in piano, karate, acrobatics, guitar, football, basketball, singing, wing chun, and more.
I'm glad I tried many things because it helped me figure out what I enjoy doing.
</p>

<p>
During my teenage years, besides going to high school and hating it, I started self-learning and working on various projects.
I was driven by the desire to create things of my own that other people would use, and the necessary learning came as a consequence of that.
I built my own websites, games, apps, and electronic devices.
My curiosity led me to learn more about programming, physics, economics, biology, philosophy, psychology, and more.
</p>

<p>
From 2020 to 2024, I was making my own Roblox games full-time.
I had multiple reasons to choose to do this instead of following my passion for AI and technology.
My successful games ended up getting more than 70 million visits in total, but the majority of my games failed.
It was a struggle with no success for months and even years, but what I learned from the experience will guide me my entire life.
</p>

<p>
Now in 2024, I'm wrapping up with Roblox and turning my focus to AI and technology. To be continued...
